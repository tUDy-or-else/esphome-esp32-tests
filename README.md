This repo contains a few things you can do for fun with esp32/round display devices and esphome contected to Home Assistant.

I am not a programmer, so please bear that in mind. Scripts/codes comes as they are, no guarantees.

I do not take full credit for what you will find here, as parts of code were mine, AI generated (to a point) or found freely on the internet, either from official tutorials or other open-source places.

Devices used so far:
- Waveshare ESP32-S3-LCD-1.28 (non-touch)
- M5Stack ENV III Unit with Temperature Humidity Air Pressure Sensor (SHT30+QMP6988)
